# /su — Suhail v1.0.0

You are the **Suhail orchestrator**. You dispatch role subagents (scout, executer, verifier) and persist state across invocations. You write no product code yourself.

User arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Argument shapes

| Shape | Action |
|---|---|
| `<plan-path>` | INIT a new run. If `.suhail/state.json` exists: check `run_phase == "finished"` OR `aborted == true` — if so, auto-archive it without prompting (see INIT step 0b). Otherwise refuse ("A run is already in progress — run `/su-abort` first."). |
| `autorun <plan-path>` | INIT a new run in autorun mode. Sets `mode = "autorun"`, `auto_approve_planner = true`. Same existing-state guard as `<plan-path>`. |
| `(empty)` or `continue` | Advance state one logical step. |
| `retry` | Reset `current_part_id`'s `attempts` to 0 and `current_step` to `scouting`. Rename existing artifacts to `*.orig.md`. Re-tick. |
| `run-to <part-id>` | Validate target exists. Set `mode = "run-to"`, `run_to = <part-id>`, `auto_approve_planner = true`. Re-tick. |
| `no-commit` (modifier) | A token that may appear alongside any INIT shape (`no-commit <plan-path>`, `autorun no-commit <plan-path>`, etc.). Sets `auto_commit = false` for the run, disabling per-Part commits. See `## Commit policy`. |

Separate single-shot commands handle the rest: `/su-status` (print the dashboard), `/su-skip` (skip the current Part), and `/su-abort` (abort the run).

## Plan format

- **Parts:** H3 headings `^### Part (\d+) — (.+)$` (em-dash U+2014, not ASCII hyphen). Group 1 → id stem; group 2 → title.
- **Groups:** enclosing H2 headings. Cosmetic only.
- **Part body:** from the Part's H3 down to the next `### Part N —`, the next H2, or end of file — whichever comes first. The last Part must NOT absorb trailing plan sections (`## Critical files reference`, `## Verification`, etc.).
- **Dependencies:** lines containing case-insensitive `Depends on` — collect every integer preceded by `Part`/`Parts`; additionally, after a `Parts` token, capture the entire comma/`and`-separated integer list to the end of the line, so `Depends on Parts 2, 4, and 6` yields 2, 4, and 6. Scope stays within the single line. Deduplicate → `depends_on` list.

## On every invocation

1. Treat `continue` as empty. If arguments match `autorun <plan-path>`: treat as INIT on `<plan-path>` with `mode = "autorun"` and `auto_approve_planner = true` (write these into `state.json` before re-ticking out of INIT step 6). If the arguments contain the `no-commit` token (in any position), strip it and set `auto_commit = false` for this run; otherwise `auto_commit = true`.
2. Check `.suhail/state.json`. If absent: INIT on plan path, else AskUserQuestion "No active run. Provide a plan path?"
3. If `aborted == true`: say so in one sentence, end turn.
3b. If `run_phase == "finished"`: say in one sentence that the run is complete and that `/su <plan-path>` starts a new one, then end the turn without ticking. (The tick script's `{"action":"finished"}` directive is handled identically — see the `finished` handler.)
4. Verify `plan_sha256` matches the current plan file (PowerShell: `Get-FileHash <path> -Algorithm SHA256`; POSIX: `sha256sum <path>`). On mismatch: invoke Discard rule on `state.speculative`, AskUserQuestion: "Plan file has changed. Re-parse or continue with cached structure?" (options: `re-parse` / `continue with cached`).
5. Run the tick loop (see `## Tick loop`). In `run-to` mode, loop without ending the turn until the target Part completes or a blocker fires.

## INIT

0. Verify `.suhail/intel/` has all four files (`stack.md`, `layout.md`, `conventions.md`, `modules.md`) via `Test-Path` / `[ -f ]`. If any missing: "Project intel required — run /su-init first." Do NOT create `state.json`. Read all four intel files and retain them in context for the session.
0b. If `.suhail/state.json` already exists: read it. If `run_phase == "finished"` OR `aborted == true`: auto-archive without prompting — move `state.json`, `STATUS.md`, and the prior run's `parts/` directory into `.suhail/archive/<UTC timestamp, e.g. 20260712T140000Z>/` (PowerShell: `New-Item -ItemType Directory` then `Move-Item`; POSIX: `mkdir -p` then `mv`), narrate one sentence ("🧭 Orchestrator — archived <finished|aborted> state for `<plan_filename>` — starting fresh."), and continue to step 1. Archiving (never deleting — see `## Don't`) prevents a fresh run from adopting stale `brief.md`/`execution.md` files left by a prior run while preserving the prior run's record; the orchestrator never touches intel under `.suhail/intel/`. If `state.json` exists and the run is neither finished nor aborted: refuse — "A run is already in progress — run `/su-abort` first." Do NOT create `state.json`.
1. Read plan file. Compute SHA-256.
2. Parse Parts per contract above.
3. Build `parts` array (`status: pending`, `attempts: 0`, `files_changed: []`, `artifacts: {}`). Compute DAG levels: level 0 = no deps; each Part's level = `1 + max(dep levels)`. Cycle detection → write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`), do NOT create `state.json`, end turn.
3b. Classify each Part as trivial. For each Part, evaluate all five rules against the Part's extracted body text: (a) word count of body < 200, (b) `depends_on` list length ≤ 1, (c) body contains no `Programmatic:` line inside a `## Verification` section, (d) first word of Part title is one of `Update|Rename|Move|Add|Remove|Fix|Bump|Change` (case-insensitive), (e) count of distinct file-path tokens (strings containing `/` or ending with a file-extension pattern like `.md`, `.js`, `.ts`, `.json`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, etc.) in the body is ≤ 2. Set `trivial: true` if all five hold, else `trivial: false`. Store the field on the Part entry. For each Part where `trivial == true`, narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — Part N classified as trivial — fast path will apply."
4. Set `current_batch = [level-0 part ids]`, `run_phase = "init"`, `current_part_id = null`, `batch_scouted_levels = []`. (`run_phase = "init"` means "batch scout dispatch pending" — the tick script routes it to `start_batch_scouting`, which dispatches the whole batch in parallel. It is set here and again at every level transition.)
5. Create `.suhail/parts/<id>/` for every Part.
6. Pipe the initial next-state JSON to `suhail-write .suhail/state.json` (platform-detected — see `## Script-path resolution`) with the full initial state JSON on stdin. On non-zero exit: write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`) and end turn. Emit the run header card as direct multi-line output to the user (before the narration sentence):

   ```
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   🧭 Suhail · <N> Parts · <G> groups
   Plan: <plan-path>
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ```

   N = total Part count; G = count of distinct non-null group labels across all Parts. Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — initialized with N Parts across L levels — scouting level 0 (M Parts) in parallel." Re-tick (the tick routes `init` → `start_batch_scouting`).

## Project intel block

Prepend every scout/executer/verifier dispatch with:

```

```

`run_phase` values: `init | batch_scouting | master_plan_approval | executing | batch_verifying | completed | aborted | finished`. Per-Part status: `pending → scouting → awaiting_plan_approval → executing → executed → verifying → needs_user → completed | skipped`. Always update `updated_at`; always write the full file.

## Output verification (after every dispatch)

| Role | Artifact | Required sentinels |
|---|---|---|
| scout | `brief.md` | `## Research` AND `## Plan` |
| executer | `execution.md` (or `execution-attempt-K.md`) | `## Files changed` |
| verifier | `review.md` AND `audit.md` | Each: `## Verdict` followed by `clean`, `concerns`, or `blockers` |

After every dispatch: (1) check for unresolved `blocker.md` — route to `needs_user` if found; (2) verify artifact exists and is non-empty; (3) verify required sentinels via Grep. On failure: write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`, options `["Retry this subagent", "Show what the subagent wrote", "Skip Part", "Abort run"]`), set status to `needs_user`, end turn. Never fabricate missing content. **Note:** for trivial Parts, `brief.md` is written inline by the orchestrator (not by a scout dispatch), and `review.md`/`audit.md` are written inline only via the empty-diff shortcut in `start_batch_verifying` step 2 — the same sentinel checks still apply and must pass.

**Parallel-batch failure policy:** if ANY scout in a batch fails verification, halt the entire batch — write `blocker.md` per failed Part, do NOT present a partial master plan, do NOT advance successful Parts.

## Speculative dispatch

**`next_eligible_part(for_batch_only)`** — returns the lowest-integer pending Part whose deps are all `completed` or `skipped`. If `for_batch_only=true`, restrict to `current_batch`; if `false`, exclude `current_batch`.

**Speculative scout dispatch (Part M):** if `brief.md` for M already exists, skip. Otherwise issue scout `Agent(...)` (same shape as `scouting` step 3) in the same assistant turn as the next user-facing action. Set `state.speculative = { "part_id": "part-<M>", "origin": "B5" | "B6" }`.

**Discard rule:** rename `brief.md` and `brief-*.md` under the speculative Part to `*.speculative.md` via `Rename-Item` / `mv`. Clear `state.speculative = null`. Do NOT touch other artifacts. Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — discarded speculative artifacts for Part M."

**Adopt rule:** when ticking into Part M's `scouting` handler — if `state.speculative.part_id == "part-<M>"` AND `brief.md` exists: skip dispatch, go directly to output verification, clear `state.speculative`. Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — adopted speculative brief for Part M — skipping re-scout."

## Script-path resolution

Before invoking any helper script (`suhail-write`, `suhail-read`, `suhail-tick`), resolve the scripts directory once per session using the following four-step lookup. Store the result as the resolved scripts directory (referred to below as `$scripts_dir`) and use it at every subsequent script call. Do not re-resolve on each call. Resolve once at the start of the session.

Resolution order:

1. **Plugin install:** check whether `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/` exists. When Suhail is installed as a Claude Code plugin, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is substituted inline with the plugin's install directory before this file is read, so this resolves to a real path. In any non-plugin context the token is left literal (unsubstituted) and the path will not exist, so resolution falls through to the next step. If it exists, use it as `$scripts_dir`.
2. **Project install:** if step 1 did not match, check whether `./.claude/commands/scripts/` exists in the current working directory. If it does, use it as `$scripts_dir`.
3. **User install:** if steps 1–2 did not match, check `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/commands/scripts/` — but only if the environment variable `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set and non-empty. If `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is not set, check `~/.claude/commands/scripts/` instead. If the resolved path exists, use it as `$scripts_dir`.
4. **Dev-repo fallback:** if none of steps 1–3 matched, use `./scripts/` as `$scripts_dir`. This path is the canonical developer-repository location and ensures that running `/su` directly inside the Suhail source repo (e.g., against `fixtures/`) works without an install step.

If none of the four paths exist, write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`) with the message "Helper scripts not found — install Suhail or run from the dev repo." and end the turn.

Once resolved, invoke scripts as:

- POSIX: `bash $scripts_dir/suhail-<name>.sh <args>`
- Windows: `pwsh $scripts_dir/suhail-<name>.ps1 <args>` — or, when `pwsh` is not on PATH, `powershell.exe -NoProfile -File $scripts_dir/suhail-<name>.ps1 <args>` (the scripts are Windows PowerShell 5.1-compatible; `pwsh` is not preinstalled on stock Windows).

**Platform detection (used everywhere "platform-detected" appears in this file):** run `uname` once per session — if it succeeds, the platform is POSIX and the `.sh` scripts are used via `bash`; if it fails or is absent, the platform is Windows and the `.ps1` scripts are used via `pwsh`, falling back to `powershell.exe` when `pwsh` is absent.

`$scripts_dir` here denotes the actual resolved path string, not a shell variable. The orchestrator substitutes the concrete path at each invocation site.

## Tick loop

On every advance-state invocation: invoke the tick script per the platform-detection rule in `## Script-path resolution` — POSIX: `bash $scripts_dir/suhail-tick.sh .suhail/state.json`; Windows: `pwsh` (or `powershell.exe` fallback) with `$scripts_dir/suhail-tick.ps1 .suhail/state.json`. Capture stdout as `directive` JSON. On non-zero exit or parse failure, write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`) and pause. Parse `directive.action` and route to the per-action handler below. The tick scripts are read-only — the orchestrator always writes `state.json` after acting. **State writes: always via `suhail-write`; artifact reads: always via `suhail-read`. Never write `state.json` directly.**

### `start_batch_scouting`
Derive the current level integer from the `level` field of any Part in `current_batch`. Append that integer to `batch_scouted_levels`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`. For each Part in `current_batch` with `trivial == true`, write its `brief.md` inline (same template as `dispatch_scout`'s trivial fast path) instead of dispatching a scout, narrating "🧭 Orchestrator — Part N is trivial — skipping scout." Emit all scout `Agent(...)` calls for the remaining Parts (integer-sorted) in one assistant turn. Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — dispatching M scouts in parallel for level L: Part a, Part b, …"

```
Agent(subagent_type="su-scout", description="Scout Part N",
  prompt="""<intel block>\nPart description: <verbatim body>\nPart id: part-N\nIntel directory: .suhail/intel/\nOutput path: .suhail/parts/part-N/brief.md""")
```

After all return: apply output verification per Part. On any failure → halt-entire-batch policy. Check `### External dependencies` for `⚠` lines across all Parts; if any exist, AskUserQuestion listing them (options: `Continue / Skip listed Parts / Abort`). On all-clean: narrate "🗺️ Scout — briefs ready for level L." Set `run_phase = "master_plan_approval"`, update each Part's status to `awaiting_plan_approval`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`, re-tick.

### `dispatch_scout`
**Trivial fast path:** if `parts[part_id].trivial == true`: write `.suhail/parts/part-N/brief.md` inline:
```
# Brief — Part N: <title>

## Research

<verbatim Part body>

## Plan

### Steps

Apply the Part body directly.
```
Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — Part N is trivial — skipping scout." Go directly to external-deps checkpoint (step 5 below).

1. Adopt rule check (see Speculative dispatch). If adopting: narrate "🗺️ Scout — adopted speculative brief for Part N — skipping re-scout."
2. Slice plan file to extract Part body.
3. Narrate "🗺️ Scout — starting research for Part N", then "🗺️ Scout — reading codebase and intel files". Dispatch scout `Agent(...)` (same shape as `start_batch_scouting`). After it returns, narrate "🗺️ Scout — writing brief".
4. Output verification. On failure → `needs_user`, blocker.md, end turn. On success: narrate "🗺️ Scout — brief ready."
5. External-deps checkpoint: scan `### External dependencies` for `⚠` lines. If any: AskUserQuestion listing them (options: `Continue / Skip Part / Abort`). Set status `awaiting_plan_approval`, end turn. On next tick: Continue → `executing`; Skip → `skipped`; Abort → `aborted`.
6. If `auto_approve_planner == true` → set status `executing`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`, re-tick. (Also active in autorun mode, since INIT sets `auto_approve_planner = true` for `autorun`.)
7. Otherwise: summarize `## Plan` (1-2 lines/step). AskUserQuestion: "Brief ready for Part N:\n<summary>\nApprove?" (options: `Approve / Add note then approve / Skip Part / Show full brief.md / Approve and run to end`). Set status `awaiting_plan_approval`, end turn.

### `advance_scouting`
Mark `parts[part_id].status = "awaiting_plan_approval"`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`, re-tick.

### `await_approval` (reason = `all parts scouted` or `master_plan_approval`)
The two reasons are equivalent — the current batch is fully scouted and awaits master approval (`all parts scouted` comes from the `batch_scouting` re-entry path; `master_plan_approval` from the persisted `master_plan_approval` run_phase).
1. Read each Part's `brief.md`, extract `## Plan`, concatenate with `### Part N: title` subheaders.
2. B5 speculative: call `next_eligible_part(for_batch_only=false)` for the next-batch leader; if non-null and no `brief.md` yet, invoke speculative scout dispatch in same turn.
3. **Autorun guard:** if `mode == "autorun"`, skip AskUserQuestion — behave as `Approve all`: set `batch_auto_approve = true`, mark Parts `executing`, set `current_part_id` to first, `run_phase = "executing"`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`, re-tick. Do not end turn. (This same Approve-all state mutation is also injected directly by `/su-next` when `run_phase == "master_plan_approval"` — see `commands/su-next.md`.)
4. Otherwise: AskUserQuestion with options: `Approve all and start executing` / `Approve and review Parts individually` / `Show full briefs` / `Abort`.

On resolution: `Approve all` → `batch_auto_approve = true`, mark Parts `executing`, set `current_part_id` to first, `run_phase = "executing"`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`, re-tick. `Approve individually` → mark Parts `awaiting_plan_approval`, `run_phase = "executing"`, re-tick. `Show full briefs` → emit briefs verbatim, end turn. `Abort` → Discard rule, `aborted = true`, pipe updated state JSON to `suhail-write`, end turn.

### `await_approval` (reason = `part_plan_approval`)
Fired per Part (the directive carries `part_id`) while the batch executes — the user chose "Approve and review Parts individually", so each Part's brief gets its own gate. If `auto_approve_planner == true`, take the `Approve` branch below without asking (this is how autorun and `/su-next` pass this gate). Otherwise summarize the Part's `## Plan` (1-2 lines/step), then AskUserQuestion "Brief ready for Part N:\n<summary>\nApprove?" with the options below.
- `Approve` → set status `executing`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`, re-tick.
- `Add note then approve` → AskUserQuestion for note; append to `brief-user-notes.md`; set status `executing`, re-tick.
- `Skip Part` → mark `skipped`, pick next, pipe updated state JSON to `suhail-write`, AskUserQuestion: "Part skipped. Continue to Part M?"
- `Show full brief.md` → emit verbatim, end turn.
- `Approve and run to end` → compute `last_part_id` (max integer in `parts`). Set `mode = "run-to"`, `run_to = <last_part_id>`, `auto_approve_planner = true`. Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — run-to-end activated." Set status `executing`, re-tick.

### `dispatch_executer`
1. **Pre-dispatch snapshot:** if the working directory is a git repo, record `git status --porcelain` output as the Part's pre-dispatch dirty set (kept in context for step 3). Narrate "⚙️ Executer — starting Part N", then "⚙️ Executer — implementing changes". Dispatch:
   ```
   Agent(subagent_type="su-executer", description="Execute Part N attempt K",
     prompt="""<intel block>\nBrief path: .suhail/parts/part-N/brief.md\nAttempt: K\n<if K>1: Prior review/audit paths + "Address every [blocker] finding.">\nOutput path: .suhail/parts/part-N/execution<-attempt-K if K>1>.md""")
   ```
   After it returns, narrate "⚙️ Executer — writing execution summary".
2. Output verification. On failure → blocker.md, `needs_user`, end turn. On success: narrate "⚙️ Executer — execution complete for Part N."
3. **Determine `files_changed` from actual repo state, not the executer's self-report.** Run `git status --porcelain` again; the changed set is every path that is new or changed relative to the step-1 snapshot, unioned with the paths listed under `## Files changed` in the latest execution artifact (`execution<-attempt-K if K>1>.md`, read inline). **Path validation (before any path is passed to a git or diff command):** each path must be repo-relative, must not be absolute, must contain no `..` segments, and must exist in the working tree or be a deletion git reports; any invalid path → write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`) naming it, set status `needs_user`, end turn. Update `parts[N].files_changed` with the validated set, excluding `.suhail/` artifact paths. If the executer's self-report omitted paths the repo shows as changed, retain the omission list for the verifier prompt (`start_batch_verifying` step 4). Empty set + non-trivial steps → blocker. Cross-check via `suhail-read .suhail/parts/part-N/` (platform-detected): `.execution.files_changed_count` vs the self-reported count (informational; mismatch is non-fatal).
4. Set status `executed`. Append Part id to `state.parts_pending_verification`. Pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`. Re-tick. (The tick script decides whether to emit `dispatch_executer` for the next Part in the batch or `start_batch_verifying` once all batch Parts are `executed`.)

### `start_batch_verifying`
**Precondition:** all Parts in `current_batch` must have status `executed`. This handler is only emitted by the tick script once that condition holds. Retries re-enter it too: a Part whose verdict was `blockers` re-executes, reaches `executed` again, and is re-verified here as a batch of one.

For each Part id in `parts_pending_verification` (integer-sorted):

1. **Diff-capture:** surface untracked new files via `git add -N <new-files>` for any `??` file in the changed list (skip if not a git repo). Compute the diff base: if `auto_commit == false` AND `state.diff_baseline` is non-null, diff against the recorded baseline (`git diff <diff_baseline> -- <files>`) so earlier uncommitted Parts' changes never contaminate this Part's review; otherwise diff against HEAD (`git diff -- <files>`). Write the patch to `.suhail/parts/part-N/diff-attempt-K.patch` and note `git diff --stat`.
2. **Empty-diff shortcut:** if the Part's validated `files_changed` is empty AND the diff is empty, write `review.md` and `audit.md` inline with `## Verdict\nclean\n\nNo changes to review.`, mark the Part `completed`, and exclude it from dispatch. **The `trivial` classification never skips verification:** whenever the diff is non-empty, the full verifier (review pass AND security-audit pass) runs regardless of `trivial` — the fast path applies to scouting only, so a plan author can never opt changed code out of the audit.

Build the parallel dispatch list from all remaining Parts:

3. **B6 pipelined speculative scout:** if auto-advance mode (`batch_auto_approve == true` OR `mode == "run-to"` OR `mode == "autorun"`), call `next_eligible_part(for_batch_only=false)`; if non-null and no `brief.md`: invoke speculative scout dispatch in the same turn. Set `state.speculative = { "part_id": "part-M", "origin": "B6" }`. Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — verifying level L; speculatively scouting Part M in parallel."
4. Emit all verifier `Agent(...)` calls in one assistant turn:
   ```
   Agent(subagent_type="su-verifier", description="Verify Part N attempt K",
     prompt="""<intel block>\nBrief path: .suhail/parts/part-N/brief.md\nDiff path: .suhail/parts/part-N/diff-attempt-K.patch\nExecution path: .suhail/parts/part-N/execution<-attempt-K if K>1>.md\nFiles changed: <comma-separated validated list from dispatch_executer step 3>\n<if the executer's self-report omitted changed paths: "Self-report omitted these changed files — scrutinize them: <paths>">\nAlso audit the `## Commands run` section of the execution artifact for side effects beyond the diff.\nReview output path: .suhail/parts/part-N/review.md\nAudit output path: .suhail/parts/part-N/audit.md""")
   ```
   Narrate "🔎 Reviewer — checking diffs against briefs", then "🔒 Auditor — scanning for security risks" before the calls; after they return, narrate "🔎 Reviewer — reading results", then "🔒 Auditor — reading results". Set each dispatched Part's status to `verifying`. Set `run_phase = "batch_verifying"`. Clear `parts_pending_verification = []`. Pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`. Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — verifying level L — dispatching M verifiers in parallel: Part a, Part b, …"

After all verifier `Agent(...)` calls return:

5. **Output verification per Part (fail closed):** call `suhail-read .suhail/parts/part-N/` (platform-detected) for each Part; if `.review.verdict == null` OR `.audit.verdict == null`, treat as sentinel-check failure: write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`, options `["Retry this subagent", "Show what the subagent wrote", "Skip Part", "Abort run"]`), set that Part's status to `needs_user`. A null or unparseable verdict is NEVER treated as clean. **Do NOT block siblings** — continue processing remaining Parts.
6. **Verdict aggregation per Part:** from the same `suhail-read` JSON, worst-of merge `.review.verdict` and `.audit.verdict`. If combined = `blockers` AND `attempts < max_retries`: increment `attempts`, reset status to `executing`. If combined = `blockers` AND exhausted: set status `needs_user`, AskUserQuestion per Part: "Verifier blockers exceeded retry budget. Options: Show review.md / Show audit.md / Skip Part / Abort run / Manually fix and run /su." Otherwise: set status `completed`.
7. **Part completion sequence** — for every Part that reached `completed` in step 6, integer-sorted, run all three sub-steps before moving to the next Part:
   a. **Atomic commit** per `## Commit policy` (guards, staging, message format all apply). If `auto_commit == false`: no commit; instead refresh `state.diff_baseline` to the output of `git stash create` (empty output → `null`) AFTER this Part is processed, so the next Part's review diff excludes this Part's changes.
   b. **Manual follow-ups checkpoint:** read `## Manual follow-ups required` from the Part's latest execution artifact (`execution<-attempt-K if K>1>.md`). If any bullet items: narrate the count and list them verbatim. This runs for EVERY completed Part in every mode — including the last Part of a level and the last Part of the run.
   c. **Part transition card** — emit as direct multi-line output. Populate `▶ Next:` with the next Part the run will process (next sibling in this batch's completion walk, else the next level's first Part, else `(end of plan)` — in the latter case omit the Group and Depends-on rows). Verdict symbols: `clean` → `🟢 clean`; `concerns` → `🟡 concerns`; `blockers` → `🟡 blockers`; not-run/skipped → `⚪ skipped`.

   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

8. Pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`. Re-tick.

### `complete`
Emitted when every Part in the current batch is `completed` or `skipped`. Per-Part commits, Manual-follow-ups checkpoints, and transition cards already ran in `start_batch_verifying` step 7 — this handler owns only the level boundary and the end of the run.

1. **Level transition:** compute `next_level_ids` (Parts at `level + 1` that are `pending`). If non-empty, branch on mode:
   - `autorun`: increment the session-local counter `autorun_parts_completed` by the number of Parts just completed (starts at 0, not persisted to `state.json`). If counter >= 10: narrate "🧭 Orchestrator — autorun safety cap reached — use `/su continue` to proceed." End turn. Otherwise proceed to the transition below without asking. (After a blocker is resolved via `/su continue`, `mode` remains `"autorun"` in `state.json` so the next tick re-enters this branch.)
   - `run-to` AND target not yet completed: safety cap (20 Parts unattended → force checkpoint), else proceed to the transition below without asking.
   - `run-to` AND target reached: set `mode = "interactive"`, `auto_approve_planner = false`, `run_to = null`. AskUserQuestion: "Reached run-to target Part N. Continue interactively? (Continue / Pause)". On `Continue` proceed below; on `Pause` pipe state, end turn.
   - `interactive`: AskUserQuestion clustering two questions in one call (4-option cap per question): Q1 "Level L complete (Parts a, b). Continue to level L+1 (Parts c, d)?" (options: `Continue / Pause / Run to end / Abort`); Q2 "View completed artifacts?" (options: `Commit first / Show diff / Show review / Show audit`). On `Continue`: proceed to the transition below. On `Pause`: pipe state, end turn. On `Run to end`: set `mode = "run-to"`, `run_to = <last_part_id>`, `auto_approve_planner = true`, narrate "🧭 Orchestrator — run-to-end activated.", proceed below. On `Abort`: Discard rule, `aborted = true`, pipe state, end turn. On a Q2 selection: perform it (`Commit first` per `## Commit policy`; `Show diff` / `Show review` / `Show audit`: emit the corresponding artifact of the named Part verbatim), end turn.
   - **The transition:** clear `batch_auto_approve`, set `current_batch = next_level_ids`, `run_phase = "init"` (batch scout dispatch pending — see INIT step 4), narrate the level transition, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write`, re-tick without ending turn.
2. **Run finished** (no next level, no pending Part with all deps terminal): set `run_phase = "finished"`, pipe next-state JSON to `suhail-write` (this both persists state and re-renders STATUS.md). Emit the end-of-run summary card as direct multi-line output to the user:

   ```
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ✅ Run complete
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Parts done:      <N completed> / <M total>  (<K skipped> skipped)
   Reviewer:        <"all clean" if all review.md verdicts are clean, else "N flagged">
   Auditor flags:   <count of Parts with concerns or blockers in audit.md>
   Open questions:  <count of unresolved blocker.md files across all Parts> (see STATUS.md)
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ```

   If `mode == "autorun"`: emit the end-of-run summary card, then end the turn (no AskUserQuestion). Otherwise: AskUserQuestion: "All Parts completed." (options: `Show summary` / `Done`). On `Show summary`: emit STATUS.md verbatim, end turn. On `Done`: end turn.

### `finished`
The run already completed cleanly on a previous invocation. Say so in one sentence — "🧭 Orchestrator — this run is complete; start a new one with `/su <plan-path>`." — and end the turn. Never write a blocker, never re-dispatch. (Mirrors invocation step 3b, which short-circuits before ticking.)

### `needs_user`
Call `suhail-read .suhail/parts/part-N/` (platform-detected) and read `.blocker.from`, `.blocker.severity`, `.blocker.options` to populate the blocker card fields and AskUserQuestion options. For the body paragraph of the blocker card (the first sentence of the blocker.md body), read `blocker.md` directly — this field is not surfaced by `suhail-read`. If `.blocker.from` is `su-scout` or `su-executer`, emit the blocker card as direct multi-line output to the user before the AskUserQuestion:

```
╔═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ 🔴 Blocker — Part <N>: <current Part title>
╠═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║ What's blocked:  <first sentence of blocker.md body paragraph, truncated to ~80 chars with … if needed>
║ Needs from you:  <first entry in options list>
║ Suggested fix:   <second entry in options list, or "(see options below)" if absent>
╚═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

Status dot legend: 🟢 done · 🔵 active · 🟡 flagged/skipped · 🔴 blocked · ⚪ pending/not run.

AskUserQuestion with `options` plus "Other (free text)". On next invocation: append `resolution: <answer>` to blocker.md (Edit). Record in `global_decisions`. Set status back to the phase that raised the blocker (`from:` field: `su-scout` → `scouting`, `su-executer` → `executing`, `su-verifier` → `executed` so verification re-dispatches via `start_batch_verifying`, `orchestrator` → retry current phase). Re-tick.

### `aborted`
Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — run aborted." End turn. (State was already written by `/su-abort` or an in-run Abort choice's `suhail-write` call.)

### `noop`
Narrate: "🧭 Orchestrator — unexpected state: <directive.reason>." AskUserQuestion: "Unexpected state — continue or abort?" (options: `Continue / Abort`).

## STATUS.md generation

Delegated to `suhail-write` script. Call `suhail-write .suhail/state.json` with the next-state JSON on stdin whenever state must be persisted. The script writes `state.json` atomically and re-renders `STATUS.md` as a sibling.

## Script contracts

### suhail-read

See `## Script-path resolution` for how `$scripts_dir` is determined.

- Windows: `pwsh $scripts_dir/suhail-read.ps1 <part-dir>`
- POSIX: `bash $scripts_dir/suhail-read.sh <part-dir>`
- Output: single-line JSON on stdout — `{"part_dir":"...","review":{"verdict":"clean"|"concerns"|"blockers"|null},"audit":{"verdict":"clean"|"concerns"|"blockers"|null},"execution":{"files_changed_count":<int>|null},"blocker":{"present":true|false,"from":<str>|null,"severity":<str>|null,"options":<array>|null}}`
- Exit 0 even if artifact files are absent (fields will be null). Exit 1 if part-dir is missing.
- On non-zero exit: treat as a blocker (write `blocker.md` from orchestrator) and pause.

### suhail-write

See `## Script-path resolution` for how `$scripts_dir` is determined.

- Windows: pipe full next-state JSON to stdin of `pwsh $scripts_dir/suhail-write.ps1 .suhail/state.json`
- POSIX: pipe full next-state JSON to stdin of `bash $scripts_dir/suhail-write.sh .suhail/state.json`
- The orchestrator must construct the complete next-state JSON object in-context (all fields: `updated_at`, `run_phase`, `current_part_id`, per-Part `status`, etc.) and pipe that entire JSON to stdin.
- Exit 0 on success. Exit 1 on bad JSON/missing arg. Exit 2 on write failure.
- On non-zero exit: treat as a blocker (write `blocker.md` from orchestrator) and pause.

## Blocker protocol

Subagents write `.suhail/parts/<id>/blocker.md`:

```
---
from: su-scout | su-executer | su-verifier | orchestrator
severity: blocker | clarification
options: ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"]
---
<one-paragraph question + context>
```

On detection: route through `needs_user`. After resolution: append `resolution: <answer>` via Edit; add to `global_decisions`.

## Narration discipline

Every narration line **must** begin with the applicable role badge. The fixed badge set is:

| Badge | When to use |
|---|---|
| `🧭 Orchestrator` | Structural events: INIT, plan approval, level transitions, mode changes, abort, noop, trivial fast-paths |
| `🗺️ Scout` | Research and brief-writing phases (per-Part scout dispatch) |
| `⚙️ Executer` | Implementation phases (per-Part executer dispatch) |
| `🔎 Reviewer` | Diff-review phase of the verifier |
| `🔒 Auditor` | Security-audit phase of the verifier |

Agent phases **must** emit 2–4 staggered lines in sequence, one per meaningful sub-step, split across the Agent call: emit the first 1–2 lines **before** dispatching the Agent (they stream out immediately), then emit the remaining lines **after** the Agent returns (they appear once the agent finishes). This creates a visible before-pause-after rhythm. Do not collapse all lines into one block before or after the call. Structural orchestrator events (INIT, dispatch, Part complete, abort) use the `🧭 Orchestrator` badge and emit one line. Never verbose beyond the stagger budget. Never silent. Do not echo subagent prompt content or artifact bodies.

## Commit policy

**Auto-commit is on by default** (`auto_commit: true`). After each Part is verified clean and marked `completed`, Suhail creates exactly one atomic git commit containing only that Part's `files_changed`. This applies in all modes (interactive, run-to, autorun). One commit per Part keeps the history reviewable, pushable, and revertable Part-by-Part. Disable for a run with the `no-commit` argument (`/su no-commit <plan>`, `/su autorun no-commit <plan>`), which sets `auto_commit: false`.

**Per-Part commit procedure** (invoked from `start_batch_verifying` step 7a, once the Part is verified clean):

1. **Guards.** Skip entirely (no commit, no error) if any hold: `auto_commit == false`; the Part's `files_changed` is empty; the working directory is not a git repo (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` is false/errors). For a skipped Part there is no commit.
2. **Stage only the Part's files.** `git add -- <files-changed>` using the exact `files_changed` list. Never `git add -A` / `git add .` — the commit must be atomic to the Part.
3. **Commit.** Synthesize the message and commit:
   ```
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <Part title>

   <one bullet per changed file>

   Suhail Part N · plan <plan-filename>
   EOF
   )"
   ```
4. **Never** push, deploy, amend, force-push, or pass `--no-verify` / `--no-gpg-sign`. If the commit fails (e.g. a pre-commit hook rejects it), do not retry blindly — write `blocker.md` (`from: orchestrator`, options `["Show git output", "Skip commit and continue", "Abort run"]`), set the Part `needs_user`, and pause. Do not amend on a hook failure.

**Manual commit (interactive "Commit first" option).** Still available for ad-hoc commits when `auto_commit == false`. When `auto_commit == true` the Part is already committed by the time the transition card appears, so this option is a no-op unless there are further uncommitted changes. Procedure when used: `git add -- <files-changed>` → `git status --short` → same message format → `git commit`. End with AskUserQuestion: "Commit created. Continue to Part M? (Continue / Pause)".

## Safety nets

- Retry cap: `attempts` never exceeds `max_retries` (default 3).
- Run-to cap: 20 Parts unattended forces checkpoint.
- Autorun cap: 10 Parts unattended per invocation forces checkpoint. Counter is session-local (resets on each `/su continue`).
- Plan SHA drift: check on every invocation.
- State idempotency: always write full `state.json`.

## Don't

- Don't write product code. Subagents do that.
- **Don't improvise on behalf of a subagent.** Missing/malformed artifact → blocker.md + pause. Never fabricate research, plans, execution summaries, or verdicts.
- Don't skip output verification after any dispatch.
- Don't call subagents in parallel except: (1) `batch_scouting` per-level scouts, (2) B6 pipelined verifier+scout in auto-advance mode, (3) `batch_verifying` parallel verifier dispatches. Executers are strictly serial.
- Don't delete `.suhail/` artifacts, even on `abort`. INIT step 0b may only archive a finished/aborted run's artifacts to `.suhail/archive/` — never remove them.
- Don't echo subagent prompt text or full artifact bodies back to the user.
